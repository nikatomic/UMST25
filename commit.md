# Git Commit


Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from `stage` to `commit` for our repo.

Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each `commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.

When we `commit`, we should always include a message.

By adding clear messages to each `commit`, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when.

The `commit` command performs a commit, and the `-m "message"` adds a message.

The Staging Environment has been committed to our repo, with the message:
"First release of Hello World!"
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World!</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bluestyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
<p>A new line in our file!</p>

</body>
</html>
```
